# nfc_audio

 Inspired by (a recent post on reddit)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/he081v/i_wrote_a_python_script_to_play_an_album_on_sonos/], I wanted to code something up that allowed me to manipulate physical devices to play music from my computer.  The idea here is that, given an NFC reader (which will eventually be embedded in a nice looking box) and some NFC stickers attached to printed out album art, we should be able to play music from the harddrive of a raspberry pi just by putting the album art on the box.
